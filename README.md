# ObservationOptimization

A set of scripts that allows to compute the best wooble distance and the optimal integration angle for candidate dwarf spheroidal galaxies to be observed with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telecopes (IACTs) of which we know the J-factor or D-factor profile, that is their dependence with respect to the distance from their center.
